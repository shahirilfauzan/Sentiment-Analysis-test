# Sentiment Analysis Prediction on Movie Reviews
 
## Project Description
This project is to create a LSTM model to classify if a review is positive or negative. By referred to the dataset that consist 50000 highly polar movie reviews by using 35,000 for training and 15,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.
